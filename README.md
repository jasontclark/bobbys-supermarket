# bobbys-supermarket
_bobby's supermarket_ is my novice attempt to write a Pythonic wrapper around the Rotten Tomatoes API.

The name of this repository comes from [Bobby's Supermarket](http://www.yellowpages.com/roanoke-rapids-nc/mip/bobbys-supermarket-464976822), a locally owned grocery store in my hometown.
