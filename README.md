# bobbys-supermarket

_bobby's supermarket_ is my novice attempt to write a Pythonic wrapper around the Rotten Tomatoes API, allowing you to search for and retrieve movie reviews data using the command line.

The name of this repository comes from [Bobby's Supermarket][bobbys], a locally owned grocery store in my hometown.

## Prerequisites

To register for the Rotten Tomatoes API, visit the Rotten Tomatoes [Developer Site][rt_dev].  Once you're registered as a developer, and you receive your API key, be sure to set a local environment variable called ROTTEN_API_KEY to the application key generated for you after regstering.
